# Chess Tactics Trainer

TJHSST Computer Systems Research Lab Senior Research Project.

This is a (WIP) personalized chess tactical training web application for professional chess players to improve their tactical vision. The goal for the application is to autogenerate tactics from a large database of expert games, classify tactics into different categories, and present them using a specialized training algorithm to the user based on the user's past experience and accuracy with tactics.

In the design of the website, I have used two CSS templates (with some of my own modifications): one for the login/register screens, and one for  the landing page. As per the license, I am listing them below:

Landing page: [Spatial](https://templated.co/spatial)

Login/Register pages: [Login v2](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/login-form-v2/)
