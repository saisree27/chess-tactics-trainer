# Chess Tactics Trainer

This is a (WIP) personalized chess tactical training web application for professional chess players to improve their tactical vision. The goal for the application is to automatically generate tactics from a large database of expert games, classify tactics into different categories, automatically predict difficulty ratings for each tactic, and present tactics using a specialized training algorithm to the user based on the user's past performance.

## Attributions

In the design of the website, I have used two CSS templates (with some of my own modifications): one for the login/register screens, and one for the landing page. The templates are cited below:

Landing page: [Spatial](https://templated.co/spatial)

Login/Register pages: [Login v2](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/login-form-v2/)

To automatically generate tactics and predict difficulty ratings, I have made use of open source databases from Lichess.org (database.lichess.org).
